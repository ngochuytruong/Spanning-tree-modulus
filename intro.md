# A Journey into the Modulus of Spanning Trees

Spanning trees are among the most versatile objects in graph theory, encoding
connectivity, reliability, and the structure of flows and cuts. In this book
we study them through the lens of *discrete modulus*, a convex optimization
framework that assigns edge densities to “spread” congestion across a finite
ground set so that every object in a given family is adequately covered at
minimal energy cost. Modulus has proved effective for families of $s$–$t$
paths, cuts, and other structures; here we develop the *spanning tree
modulus*, and then connect it to matroidal geometry, revealing clean duality,
intrinsic edge usage statistics, and algorithmic consequences.

This book is intended for graduate students and researchers in computer science, mathematics, and operations research who have an interest in graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and the development of new mathematical tools for analyzing complex networks. We hope that the theory of the spanning tree modulus will not only solve existing problems but also open up new avenues of research for years to come.
