# A Journey into the Modulus of Spanning Trees

Spanning trees are among the most important objects in graph theory. In this book,
we study them through the lens of discrete modulus, a convex optimization
framework that measures the richness of families of objects defined on a finite set.
Modulus has proved effective for families of $s$â€“$t$ paths, cuts, and other structures.
Here, we develop the spanning tree modulus. The modulus of the spanning tree family,
in turn, is related to other concepts in graph theory, such as strength and fractional arboricity.

The purpose of this book is to provide readers with insights into the spanning tree modulus. The source of the book can be found [here](https://github.com/ngochuytruong/Spanning-tree-modulus).
